    <p class="description">When the club first started, there was just one executive committee. It hosted sessions on how to choose statistics classes for future semesters and also hosted movie nights on "math movies" such as Moneyball and Beautiful Mind. The club was first started to facilitate more social events for statistics students. The club started with three committees: Events, Project, and Marketing. Afterwards, a competition committee (Kaggle) was added.</p>
